## üìä Project Introduction
As someone who loves movies and TV shows, I have always been fascinated by the evolution of streaming platforms and how they have changed the way people consume entertainment. This project was an exciting opportunity to explore Netflix‚Äôs content library through data analysis and visualization.

Netflix is a leading OTT (Over-the-Top) streaming platform, offering a vast collection of TV shows, movies, and documentaries to millions of subscribers worldwide. It provides a vast collection of TV shows, movies, anime, and documentaries, making it a dominant force in the streaming industry. With the rise of affordable smartphones and high-speed internet, streaming services have become more accessible than ever, eliminating the need for traditional cable TV. The competition between platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ has intensified, leading to an ever-growing demand for data-driven insights to enhance content strategy.

Given this dynamic landscape, understanding Netflix‚Äôs content growth and distribution is crucial. This report explores Netflix‚Äôs content trends from 2000 to 2020, examining how the platform has expanded its library over time. The insights gained from this study could help in understanding broader streaming industry trends, including content production strategies, genre preferences, and changes in audience engagement. The project includes **interactive visualizations** using **Plotly Dash**, enabling dynamic exploration of the dataset.

## üõ† Data Preparation & Cleaning
### üìÇ Dataset: `Cleaned_Netflix_Titles_Data.csv`
The dataset underwent preprocessing to ensure consistency, handle missing values, and optimize it for visualization.

### üîç Cleaning Process
- **Standardization**:
  - Trimmed spaces and converted column names to lowercase for consistency.
  - Extracted `year_added` from `date_added` for trend analysis.

- **Handling Missing Data**:
  - `release_year`: Filled missing values with `2020` for consistency.
  - `date_added`: Replaced missing entries with `"Unknown"`.
  - `country`: Entries with multiple countries were split into separate records.

- **Feature Selection & Transformation**:
  - Retained relevant fields like `type`, `release_year`, `rating`, `country`, and `categories`.
  - Parsed `listed_in` to select only the primary genre for better categorization.

### üìä Sampling Methodology
- Focused on data from **2000 to 2020**, as trends became more significant post-2000.
- Ensured computational efficiency while maintaining meaningful insights.

This cleaning process allowed for **accurate trend analysis** and ensured that the dataset was well-structured for visualization. üöÄ
